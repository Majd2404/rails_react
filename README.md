For this application, we are going to build both the front-end and back-end within a single Rails application. However, weâ€™re only going to load React on a specific part of a specific view.

We can build out other pages using .erb files(Embedded Ruby is a templating language based on Ruby. Puppet evaluates ERB templates with the template and inline_template functions.).

Not everything needs to be in React. Imagine if we want to add a contact us page,  or an about page in the future?  It would be cumbersome to need to build these pages in React.
